## Education

- **Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering** 
  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *01/2017 - 03/2021*
  Development, verification and validation of a C++ computer code for the simulation of thermal-hydraulics of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, primarily Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors, and integration of the developed code within the open-source [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam) multi-physics code. The doctoral dissertation is freely available [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d).

- **M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering**
  *Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich ([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html)), Swtizerland*
  *09/2014 - 09/2016*
  The program was jointly held by the ETHZ and EPFL, and involved a semester at the Paul Scherrer Institut ([PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en/research)). It convered nuclear engineering domains ranging from neutron physics and fluid thermal-hydraulics to dosimetry and radiation safety, as well as eligible courses, which I oriented towards nuclear fusion and particle-accelerator design topics.

- **B.Sc. in Engineering Physics**
 *Politecnico di Milano ([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/)), Italy*
 *09/2011 - 07/2014*
