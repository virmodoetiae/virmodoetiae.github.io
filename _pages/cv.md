## Personal Details

- *Birth date, place*: 12 July 1992, Belgrade, Serbia
- *Nationality*:       Serbian, Italian
- *Address*:           Feldstrasse 15, 5412 Gebenstorf, Aargau, Switzerland
- *E-mail*:            sradman@protonmail.com

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering** 
  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *January 2017 - March 2021*
  Development, verification and validation of a C++ computer code for the simulation of thermal-hydraulics of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, primarily Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors. The doctoral studies also involved the integration of the developed code within the open-source [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam) multi-physics code. The doctoral dissertation is freely available [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d).

- **M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering** (with distinction)
  *Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich ([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html)), Swtizerland*
  *September 2014 - September 2016*
  The program was jointly held by the ETHZ and EPFL, and involved a semester at the Paul Scherrer Institut ([PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en/research)). It convered nuclear engineering domains ranging from neutron physics and fluid thermal-hydraulics to dosimetry and radiation safety, as well as eligible courses, which I oriented towards nuclear fusion and particle-accelerator design topics.

- **B.Sc. in Engineering Physics**
  *Politecnico di Milano ([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/)), Italy*
  *September 2011 - July 2014*

## Professional Experience

- **Scientist**
  *[Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en), Villigen, Switzerland*
  *September 2025 - Present*
  At the Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Thermal-Hydraulics (LRT), my activities are focused on higher-
  resolution simulation methods (neutronics and thermal-hydraulics) for Boiling Water Reactors to support
  the operation of Swiss nuclear power plants and advance simulation methods and frameworks.

- **Modeling and simulation engineer**
  *[Casale](https://casale.ch/), Lugano, Switzerland*
  *January 2022 - July 2025*
  Variety of activities within the digital engineering department: 1) development and maintenance of model-based software descriptive of proprietary Casale technology for the design of chemical plant unit-operations; 2) development and maintenance of proprietary web application back-ends; 3) management and analysis of large technical data-sets.

- **IAEA Training Course Series assistant**
  *International Atomic Energy Agency ([IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/)), Vienna, Austria*
  *September 2022 - December 2022*
  The remote work (performed in Lausanne, Switzerland) consisted in the drafting and finalization of an IAEA Training Course Series book related to a [jointly-held ICTP-IAEA course](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9658/) on the theoretical foundations and application of Computational Fluid Dynamics in nuclear engineering.
  
- **Scientific collaborator**
  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *April 2021 - July 2021*
  Extension of the code developed during the Ph.D. (within [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam)) to enable the analysis of more traditional nuclear reactor designs.

- **Intern**
  *Nationale Genossenschaft für die Lagerung radioaktiver Abfälle ([Nagra](https://nagra.ch/en/why-nagra/)), Switzerland*
  *July 2015 - September 2015*
  Activation calculations for the [PSI proton accelerator](https://www.psi.ch/en/research/the-psi-proton-accelerator) beamline shielding with the [FLUKA](http://www.fluka.org/fluka.php) Monte Carlo code.

## Research Experience

- **IAEA Coordinated Research Project participant**
  *International Atomic Energy Agency ([IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/)), Vienna, Austria*
  *July 2018 - December 2022*
  Participation to a [Coordinated Research Project](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/new-crp-benchmark-analysis-of-fftf-loss-of-flow-without-scram-test-i32011) by the IAEA on computer code benchmarking for fast nuclear reactor concept analyses.

- **Teaching assistant**
  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *January 2017 - March 2021*
  Teaching assistant duties at the EPFL consisted in: 1) exercise sessions for a M.Sc.-level neutron physics course; 2) experimental sessions for a M.Sc.-level radiation protection course; 3) experimental sessions for a B.Sc.-level general physics course, from Newtonian mechanics to black-body radiation.
