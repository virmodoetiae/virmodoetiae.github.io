For a more structured summary, you may refer to my [curriculum vitæ](#curriculum-vitæ).

My name is Stefan Radman, and I am a nuclear engineer, Ph.D., working as a simulation and modeling engineer at [Casale](https://casale.ch/), a Swiss company operating in the domain of chemical engineering. As a member of the digital engineering department of Casale, my duties range from developing proprietary software for the simulation of various unit operations, to devloping back-ends for various proprietary web applications, with the goal to improve the effectiveness and efficency of Casale company operations at different scales. These activities benefit from my extensive knowledge of the C++, Python, and to a lesser extent C# programming languages.

In my daily work, I often make use of the valuable knowledge I matured during my [doctoral studies](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d) at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), which revolved around developing computational methodologies and tools (in C++) for the simulation of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, such as Sodium-coooled Fast Reactors. These tools primarily focused on the simulation of reactor thermal-hydraulics (extensively rooted in Computational Fluid Dynamics methodologies ranging from one to three spatial dimensions) and have been included in the open-source [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam) multi-physics nuclear reactor simulation code, to which I contributed with great enthusiasm.

The doctoral studies were a natural continuation of my Master-level studies in nuclear engineering, a degree jointly organized by the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology of Zürich ([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html)) and Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). This degree provided me with a solid foundation in the nuclear sciences and technology domain, and it allowed me to experience life across different Swiss cantons, namley French-speaking Vaud, and German-speaking Zürich and Aargau. It is in the latter canton that a semester at the [Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en/research) and an internship at [Nagra](https://nagra.ch/en/why-nagra/), the Swiss national cooperative for the disposal of radioactive waste, further expanded my fields of interest.

Prior to my time in Switzerland, I used to live in Monza, Italy, where I grew up with a keen fascination by the natural sciences. This brought me to the starting point of my adventure, namely a Bachelor degree in Engineering Physics at the Politecnico of Milan ([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/)).
