For a concise summary, you may refer to my [curriculum vitæ](#curriculum-vitæ). 

Currently, I am a simulation and modeling engineer working at [Casale](https://casale.ch/), a Swiss company operating in the domain of chemical engineering. Nonetheless, my journey did not start here, nor is its future already set in stone.

I was born in Belgrade, Serbia, on July 12th 1992, during the tumultuous times of the dissolution of former Yugoslavia. I owe to my parents, Danica and Darko, for setting out to secure a better future on the other side of the Adriatic Sea, in Italy.

I grew up in the Italian town of Monza, not far from Milan, and early on, I discovered (or developed?) a fascination with trying to understand how things worked around me. How do cars move? Why do plans fly? Why do I get a small electric shock if I touch a capacitor connected to an aluminum foil spread over the screen of an old CRT TV? (If it sounds oddly specific, it is because I tried it indeed!). By the time I was old enough to appreciate what an atom was, it was learning the very basics of nuclear energy that left me in such a state of awe that I knew I wanted to orient my studies in said direction. However, this happened when I was around 12 years old, so I knew I had to wait a lot more!

First, came the Paolo Frisi scientific lyceum (or "liceo scientifico" in Italian) in Monza, which imbued me with the necessary knowledge and rigor to tackle university studies.

Second, came the Politecnico di Milano. There have been no Bachelor-level degrees in nuclear engineering ever since the extremely unfortunate Italian decision to abandon nuclear power in the 1980s, so I opted for what I thought was a good starting point, namely a B.Sc. in Engineering Physics. This challanging experience provided me with a much greater appreciation of formal mathematics on one hand (which I was never particularly passionate about up to that point), and of quantum mechanics on the other.

Third, came Switzerland. I finally tackled my original ambitions by pursuing a Master-level degree in nuclear engineering jointly organized by the Federal Institutes of Technology of Zürich and Lausanne.

# Curriculum Vitæ

## Personal details

- *Birth date, place*: 12 July 1992, Belgrade, Serbia
- *Nationality*:       Serbian, Italian
- *Address*:           Via al Boschetto 4, 6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland
- *E-mail*:            sradman@protonmail.com

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering** 
  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *01/2017 - 03/2021*
  Development, verification and validation of a C++ computer code for the simulation of thermal-hydraulics of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, primarily Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors, and integration of the developed code within the open-source [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam) multi-physics code. The doctoral dissertation is freely available [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d).

- **M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering**
  *Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich ([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html)), Swtizerland*
  *09/2014 - 09/2016*
  The program was jointly held by the ETHZ and EPFL, and involved a semester at the Paul Scherrer Institut ([PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en/research)). It convered nuclear engineering domains ranging from neutron physics and fluid thermal-hydraulics to dosimetry and radiation safety, as well as eligible courses, which I oriented towards nuclear fusion and particle-accelerator design topics.

- **B.Sc. in Engineering Physics**
  *Politecnico di Milano ([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/)), Italy*
  *09/2011 - 07/2014*
