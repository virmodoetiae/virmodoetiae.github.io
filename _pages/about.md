For a more structured and concise summary, you may refer to my **[curriculum vitæ](#curriculum-vitæ)**.

My name is Stefan Radman, and I am a nuclear engineer, Ph.D., working as a simulation engineer at **[Casale](https://casale.ch/)**, a Swiss chemical engineering company in Lugano. I develop software for the simulation of a broad range of chemical plant unit operations, as well web applications back-ends, with the goal to improve the effectiveness of company operations. These activities benefit from my extensive knowledge of the C++, C# and Python programming languages.

In my daily work, I make use of the valuable knowledge I matured during my **[doctoral studies](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d)** at the **[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)**. These studies revolved around developing computational methodologies and tools (in C++) for the simulation of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, such as Sodium-coooled Fast Reactors. Primarily, the focus was on the simulation of reactor thermal-hydraulics (via Computational Fluid Dynamics methodologies) and the resulting code was integrated in the open-source **[GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam)** multi-physics simulation code, to which I contributed with great enthusiasm.

The doctoral studies were a natural continuation of my Master degree in nuclear engineering, jointly organized by the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology of Zürich **([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html))** and Lausanne **([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/))**. This degree provided me with a solid foundation in the domain of nuclear science and technology. It also allowed me to experience life across different Swiss cantons, namley French-speaking Vaud, and German-speaking Zürich and Aargau. It is in the latter canton that a semester at the **[Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en/research)** and an internship at **[Nagra](https://nagra.ch/en/why-nagra/)**, the Swiss national cooperative for the disposal of radioactive waste, further expanded my fields of interest.

Prior to Switzerland, I used to live in Monza, Italy, where I grew up with a keen fascination for the natural sciences. This ultimately led me to pursue a Bachelor degree in Engineering Physics at the Politecnico of Milan **([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/))**.

Needless to say, not everything in life is about work, and I have approached various side activities and hobbies through time. Some of these, like windsurfing, did not last long, but others, like playing the electric guitar, or creative outbursts in the artistic and programmming domains, have stuck with me for a long time. I talk about these in my **[blog](/blog/)**.

  *Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), Swtizerland*
  *January 2017 - March 2021*
  Development, verification and validation of a C++ computer code for the simulation of thermal-hydraulics of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, primarily Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors. The doctoral studies also involved the integration of the developed code within the open-source [GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam) multi-physics code. The doctoral dissertation is freely available [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d).
