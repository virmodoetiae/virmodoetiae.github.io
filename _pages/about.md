For a more structured summary, you may refer to my **[curriculum vitæ](/cv/)**.

My name is Stefan Radman, and I am a scientist at the **[Laboratory for Reactory Physics and Thermal-Hydraulics (LRT)](https://www.psi.ch/en/lrt)** at **[PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en)**, the largest Swiss research centre for natural and engineering sciences. With my work, I contribute both to the operation of Swiss nuclear power plants and to the hopeful future deployment of advanced nuclear systems.

In my daily work, I make use of the valuable knowledge I matured both during my experience as a modeling and software engineer at **[Casale](https://casale.ch/)**, a Swiss chemical engineering company, as well as during my **[doctoral studies](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/8a8972df-3200-4375-92e0-dd9717bceb4d)** at the **[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)**. These studies revolved around developing computational methodologies and tools (in C++) for the simulation of advanced nuclear reactor concepts, such as Sodium-coooled Fast Reactors. Primarily, the focus was on the simulation of reactor thermal-hydraulics (via Computational Fluid Dynamics methodologies) and the resulting code was integrated in the open-source **[GeN-Foam](https://gitlab.com/foam-for-nuclear/GeN-Foam)** multi-physics simulation code, to which I contributed with enthusiasm.

The doctoral studies were a natural continuation of my Master degree in nuclear engineering, jointly organized by the **([ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html))** and **([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/))**. This degree provided me with a solid foundation in the domain of nuclear science and technology. It also allowed me to experience life across different Swiss cantons, namley French-speaking Vaud, and German-speaking Zürich and Aargau. It is in the latter canton that a semester at PSI and an internship at **[Nagra](https://nagra.ch/en/why-nagra/)**, the Swiss national cooperative for the disposal of radioactive waste, further expanded my fields of interest.

Prior to Switzerland, I used to live in Monza, Italy, where I grew up with a keen fascination for the natural sciences. This led me to pursue a Bachelor degree in Engineering Physics at the Politecnico of Milan **([PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/en/))**, which was the cornerstone of my professional journey.

Needless to say, not everything in life is about work, and I have approached various side activities and hobbies through time. Some of these, like windsurfing, did not last long, but others, like playing the electric guitar, or creative outbursts in the artistic and programmming domains, have stuck with me for a long time. I talk about these in my **[blog](/blog/)**.
